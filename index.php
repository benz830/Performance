<b><h2><font color="orange"> What is Poverty?</B></h2></font>
<b><font color="white">Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks
<br> the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. 
<br> Poverty means that the income level from employment is so low that basic
<br> human needs can't be met.</b></font></br>
  <br>
<br><b><h2><font color="yellow"> What is the Cycle of Poverty </b></h2><font>
<font color="gray"><b> Poverty can be a trap. For someone to get out of poverty, they need opportunities such as education,
<br> clean water, medical facilities nearby, and financial resources. Without these basic elements, poverty 
<br>becomes a cycle from one generation to the next.<font></b>
